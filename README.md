# 📘 DSA Practice Questions

This repository contains my personal collection of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** practice questions and solutions. The goal is to strengthen problem-solving skills and prepare for technical interviews.

I am solving problems from platforms like **LeetCode**, **GeeksforGeeks**, **HackerRank**, **Codeforces**, and other competitive programming sites.

## 📂 Repository Structure

- `LeetCode/` – Solutions to problems from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/).
- `GFG/` – Problems from [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/).
- `HackerRank/` – Practice problems from [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/).
- `Codeforces/` – Solutions from contests on [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/).
- `Others/` – Problems from other platforms or custom challenges.

Each folder contains:
- 📄 Problem statement (if needed)
- ✅ Solution code (Python, C++, Java, etc.)
- 📝 Notes or explanations (for tricky questions)
